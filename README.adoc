= mob_suite

unofficial containerization of genomic software MOB-suite (https://github.com/phac-nml/mob-suite), with database

https://github.com/phac-nml/mob-suite
has docker image and singularity definition file, 
but on 2024-08 when I used the docker image it didn't work.

also, theirs dont have database needed by mob_init, 
I am running that inside the container so it i will be a fat container, with the db embeded in it, 
so mob_recon is ready to run

intenteded for use in HPC
